# TODO: Implement Facebook Posts Integration

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update `app/api/facebook/posts/route.js` to fetch posts from Facebook Graph API using page ID `61576088153701`, access token, and fields like message, created_time, attachments.
- [x] Update `components/FacebookPosts.jsx` to fetch data from the API route and render posts with text, images, and timestamps.

## Followup Steps
- [x] Set environment variables in `.env.local` (NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_APP_ID, FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN, FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID=61576088153701).
- [ ] Obtain a valid Page Access Token with pages_read_engagement permission for the page ID 61576088153701 (current token is app token, insufficient for page posts).
- [ ] Verify the page ID is correct and the page is public.
- [ ] Test the implementation by running the app and visiting the social page.
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully (e.g., token expiration, permissions).
